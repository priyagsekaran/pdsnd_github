### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data with python

### Description
The project uses Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in United States - Chicago, New York City & Washington. Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

With this project, I am presently more able and sure in leveraging the control of Python to tell stories behind data. Python packages that were used in this project include NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Important statistical data was calculated as below:

Popular times of travel
Popular stations and trip
Trip duration
User info
### Files used
I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. This project uses data for the first six month of 2017

### Credits
Thanks to Udacity for this wonderful course & a Nanodegree Program in "Programming for Datascience with Python".
